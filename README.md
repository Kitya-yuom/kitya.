I am interested in learning things regarding software development, such as API development, testing strategies , and DevOps practices.

Currently, I am delving into some programming languages, working on some projects, and writing scripts.

For my hobby, I enjoy keeping up with technology news. I also browse some websites to stay up-to-date with recent developments and innovations.
